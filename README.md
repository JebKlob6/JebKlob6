## 🌐 LLM Projects

My current projects revolve around using machine learning models to process and analyze data from inputs or files. These projects leverage a series of models to generate responses based on the context and questions provided.

### Featured Models:
- `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`
- `MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-248`
- ...and others.

These models are adept at interpreting context and questions, generating insightful responses based on the input data.

## 📘 Jupyter Lab Notebooks Repository

Welcome to my repository of Jupyter Lab notebooks, a chronicle of my journey through Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses offered by Deeplearning.ai via Stanford Online. This collection features assignments and projects across various facets of machine and deep learning.

### Courses Overview:

The repository is methodically organized according to the courses and their respective weeks, containing notebooks and datasets critical to each week's learning objectives.

Here's a quick overview of the courses covered:

- **Advanced Learning Algorithms: 
  -Exploring advanced algorithms and their applications.
- **Supervised Learning: Regression & Classification:
  -Diving deep into supervised learning techniques for both regression and classification problems.
- **Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning & Recommenders:
  -Uncovering the power of unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems.
