## 🌐 LLM Projects

My current projects revolve around using machine learning models to process and analyze data from inputs or files. These projects leverage a series of models to generate responses based on the context and questions provided.

### Featured Models:
- `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`
- `MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-248`
- ...and others.

These models are adept at interpreting context and questions, generating insightful responses based on the input data.

## 📘 Jupyter Lab Notebooks Repository

Welcome to my repository of Jupyter Lab notebooks, a chronicle of my journey through Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses offered by Deeplearning.ai via Stanford Online. This collection features assignments and projects across various facets of machine and deep learning.

### Courses Overview:

The repository is methodically organized according to the courses and their respective weeks, containing notebooks and datasets critical to each week's learning objectives.

- **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
  - Weeks 1, 2: Exploration of cutting-edge algorithms and their real-world applications.
- **Supervised Learning: Regression & Classification**
  - Weeks 1 to 4: Deep dive into supervised learning techniques, focusing on both regression and classification challenges.
- **Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning & Recommenders**
  - Weeks 1 to 3: Discovering the potential of unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning strategies, and recommendation systems.
